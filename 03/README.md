# Day 3

I feel like my usage of MapSet could be cleaner, but otherwise this solution seems pretty optimal.

We could use bitfields here to optimize the set intersection, but for sets of this size I don't
think it's worth it.

## Day 1

I'm not sure if the problem required potentially multiple common items, but this solution handles
that scenario by summing their scores.

## Day 2

I initially forgot that I was still looking for the intersection, but otherwise this is
straightforward.
