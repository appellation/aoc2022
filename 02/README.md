It's possible that this could be more efficient by using structs, but Elixir doesn't seem to like
accessing structs in script code. Also, such optimization would be relying on BEAM and is not
inherently an algorithmic improvement.

I would have liked to create a better method for calculating the winner, but a few manually
written maps seemed to be the simplest approach.

Given that both solutions are O(N), I don't believe they can be improved.
